### Summary

### Relevance for this project

Question:
What were the participants asked to rate? The general quality of the image or the quality of the text. If general quality, then the recognition of text is not fully comparable to the MOS scores.

The authors use the double stimulus. The participants first see the uncompressed image for 10 seconds, then a gray image and finally the compressed image to rate. The authors write "the higher the score, the better the perceptual quality is deemed". Text quality specifically is not mentioned. So even though the focus of most of the images is text, it must be assumed that the participants took other parts of the image, like edges or decoration patterns into account for their rating.

So if we were to just make the ground truth the text (and its rough position), we can't perfectly compare the text error rate to the MOS. For example, let's say the image in question has some text which is perfectly recognized by human and machine, but the rest of the image is rated low for some reason by the human. Our metric from OCR would maybe rate such image 9/10, but the MOS might be 6/10 because some other parts of the image influence the rating.
