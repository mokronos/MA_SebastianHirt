\chapter{Abstract}

In this thesis, the application of text recognition algorithms for the assessment of screen content image quality is explored.
By researching state-of-the-art text recognition and detection methods, generating a labeled dataset, and investigating the correlation between text recognition rates and human judgement, a valuable addition to current research is provided.
