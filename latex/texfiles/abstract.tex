\chapter{Abstract}

Screen content images are common in today's digital interconnected world.
They are used in many different applications, such as video conferencing, remote desktop applications, and video streaming.
Thus, the quality of these images is important for the user experience.
In this thesis, the application of \gls{ocr} algorithms for the assessment of screen content image quality is explored.
We research state-of-the-art \gls{ocr} methods, generate a labeled dataset and investigate the correlation between the performance of \gls{ocr} and human judgment on images with different types of distortion.
The results indicate that \gls{ocr} could be a valuable tool in screen content image quality assessment for certain types of distortions, particularly when used in combination with other metrics.
