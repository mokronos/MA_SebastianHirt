# Latex Thesis Generation

This folder contains the source code for generating the thesis in PDF format.

## Requirements

pdfLaTeX

## Usage

Just run `make` in this folder to generate the PDF, and all the log/aux files.

Run `make clean` to remove all generated files, but the PDF.

## Images

Images are mainly pulled directly from the sibling directories, so generating them first, might be necessary.
