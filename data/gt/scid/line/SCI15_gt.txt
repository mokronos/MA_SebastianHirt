SYNOPSIS
The sequel to the worldwide smash hit "Olympus Has Fallen" begins in London, where the British Prime
Minister has passed away under mysterious circumstances. His funeral is a mustatted event for
leaders of the western world. But what starts out as the most protected event on earth, turns into a
deadly plot to kill the world's most powerful leaders, devastate every known landmark in the British
capital, and unleash a terrifying vision of the future. Only three people have any hope of stopping it: the
President of the United States, his formidable secret service head (Gerard Butler), and an English MI-6
agent who rightly trusts no one.
Cineleisure Orchard is pleased to showcase Screen 3 that features only couple seating. Should you select a movie session that is
scheduled in this hall, please note that all tickets have to be purchased in pairs (i.e. even numbers). The seating plan in the booking
website will reflect that all seats are couple seats, for your easy reference.
