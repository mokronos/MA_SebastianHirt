An example of how Facebook Ads can

grow your business

Orr |

Here’s a hypothetical example. Imagine you’re the owner of

YouthRazor Inc. and you’re about to launch your new product:

The most revolutionary razor on the market for young people

dealing with their first shaving problems.

The product is awesome and the market is simply huge - you

just have to let every male teenager about your product! So,

you go on Google and start bidding for keywords like

“Teenager shaving,” “Teenager razor,” etc. Gosh! The results

are amazing! It seems like every person performing those

searches clicks on your ads, and most of them buy your

product.
