Younger me tended to take
the short view, feeling every-

now, as a middle-aged woman,
I definitely took the long view.
Itoccurs to me that not only
readers but also writers often
fall into the habit of taking ei-

the older me to be somewhere
in the mix of this YA book,
though not to give Jama

lessons. But given that Belzhar
takes place in a special class
at a special boarding school, it
seemed appropriate that there
would indeed be some kind of

that’s been going on, empathy
has quietly been forming; it’s

do your version of what that
writer did: you want to tell the
truth, fiction-style.

There are quite a few of us
former teenagers—women in
the middle of their lives (and
some men, for sure)—who
have never forgotten what it
felt like to read The Bell Jar for
the first time. So what are we
supposed to do with all that
leftover feeling?

Me, I decided to write a
book. /
