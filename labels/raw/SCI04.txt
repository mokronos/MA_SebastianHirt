 

Histogram based Enhancement

 

We have discussed various forms of mapping
function f(x) that leads to different
enhancement results.

The natural question is: How to select an
appropriate f(x) for an arbitrary image?

One systematic solution is based on the
histogram information of an image.

Histogram of an image represents the relative
frequency of occurrence of various gray levels
in the image.
