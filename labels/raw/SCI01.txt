Huaqiao University (HQU) was established by the Chinese central government in 1960 in
Quanzhou, a coastal city in Fujian Province in the Southeast of China, for the education of
overseas Chinese. The first president of HQU was Mr. LIAO Chengzhi, an outstanding social
activist and senior state leader of China. In 2004, a landmark decision was made to build a
second campus in Xiamen city, one of Chinaâ€™s four earliest special economic zones, and that
campus was inaugurated in 2006.

For more than half a century, HQU has developed into a comprehensive institution of higher
education capable of program offerings in 12 disciplines--philosophy, economics, law,
education, literature, history, science, engineering, agriculture, medical science, management,
and arts. HQU has a comparative strength in Chinese language and culture education, science
and engineering programs, such as Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Architecture,
Material Science and Pharmacy. Overall, the 29 colleges and 90 research institutes have been
supporting numerous projects funded by both government and industries, one of which led to
the award of the National Science and Technology Development by the central government.
