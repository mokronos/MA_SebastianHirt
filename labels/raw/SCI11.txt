bed with a big white bear is my bed
| lay down here everyday. On the
left of the bed is my desk. there is a
computer, an notebook, a pen, a
light on it. | learn konwledge every
night on the desk, so nothing could
seperate me with it. | ike watching
TV. The TV is before the bed.

  

I live on the 7th floor in the Tower
Building, in the southern suburb in
Xian. My house has a good
Sunlight as it faces south. There are
several furnitures in my house, The
bed lies on the southeast corner,
adjacent to the round table.

   

 

There are 2 floors with 8 rooms

including the kitchen, canteen, living
room and guest's room. The living
is the most favorite room because
you can see a beautiful garden out
of the window and there are lots
kind of flowers. The most important
is there is a good piano stood there.
That's so nice! Looking forward to.

seeing you.
