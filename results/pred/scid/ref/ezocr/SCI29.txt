Abstract small black and brown dog play with red ball in the grass dog play with a red ballin In this paper; we propose multimodal convolutional neu- 2rss ral networks (m-CNNs) for matching image and sentence: small black and Drown dog play with redioall Our m-CNN provides an end-to-end framework with convo lutional architectures to exploit image representation, word black and ball composition, and the matching relations between the two brown modalities: More specifically; it consists of one image CNN encoding the image content and one matching CNN mod- Erass the joint representation of image and sentence. The matching CNN composes different semantic fragments from Figure Multimodal   matching  relations   between  image   and words and learns the inter-modal relations between image sentence. The  words and phrases, such as grass red and the composed fragments at different levels, thus ful- ball"  and 'small black and brown dog play ly exploit the matching relations between image and sen- with red ball", correspond to the areas of their tence. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed grounding   meanings The sentence small black and m-CNNs can effectively capture the information necessary brown dog play with red ball in the grass for image and sentence matching: More specifically; our expresses the meaning of the whole image. proposed m-CNNs  significantly outperform the state-of the-art approaches for bidirectional image and sentence re- whole sentence 'small black and brown dog play trieval on the Flickr8K and Flickr3OK datasets with red ball in the grass expressing a com- plete meaning, associates with the whole image. These matching relations should be all taken into consideration for an accurate multimodal matching between image and sen- 1. Introduction tence.
