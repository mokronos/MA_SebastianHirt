Abstract small black and brwn dog play wlth red boll intne grass play with balle In this paper; we propose multimodal convolutional neu- ua55 ral networks (m-CNNs) for matching image and sentence: {Mallblack and brown dog pla; writh red ball Our m-CNN provides an end-to-end framework with COnvo - lutional architectures to exploit image representation, word blackand composition, and the matching relations between the two DiOwn CoE modalities More specifically; it consists Of one image CNN encoding the image content and one matching CNN mod- the joint representation of image and sentence. The matching CNN composes different semantic fragments from Figure Multimodal   matching   relations   between image and words and Iearns the inter-modal relations between image sentence.
