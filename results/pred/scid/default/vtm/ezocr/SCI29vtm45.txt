Abstract small black and brown dog play with red ball in the grass play writh a red ball in In this paper; we propose multimodal convolutional neu- 2rss ral networks (r-CNNs) for matching image and sentence: small black and brown dog play with rediall Our m-CNN provides an end-to-end framework with convo- lutional architectures to exploit image representation, word black and reo ball composition, and the matching relations between the two brown dog modalities More specifically; it consists of one image CNN encoding the image content and one matching CNN mod- the joint representation of image and sentence. The matching CNN composes different semantic fragments from Figure Multimodal  matching   relations   between  image and words and learns the inter-modal relations between image sentence. The words and phrases, such as grass red and the composed fragments at different levels,  thus ful- ball"- and small black and brown dog play ly exploit the matching relations between image and sen- with red ball", correspond to the image areas of their tence. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed grounding   meanings The sentence small black and m-CNNs can effectively capture the information necessary brown dog play with red ball in the grass for image and sentence matching: More specifically; our expresses the meaning of the whole image. proposed m-CNNs   significantly outperform the   state-of- the-art approaches for bidirectional image and sentence re- whole sentence small black and brown dog play trieval on the Flickr8K and Flickr3OK datasets: with red ball in the grass expressing a com- plete meaning  associates with the whole image. These matching relations should be all taken into consideration for an accurate multimodal matching between image and sen- 1. Introduction tence.
